        " * The return statement in a Python function is used to send a value back to the caller of the function. It serves two primary purposes:\n",
        " 1. Terminate the function: The return statement ends the function’s execution and transfers control back to the calling code.\n",

        " • Definition: An iterable is any object that can return its elements one at a time. Examples include lists, tuples, strings, sets, dictionaries, and more.\n",

        " • Definition: An iterator is an object that represents a stream of data; it produces one item at a time when you call the next() function on it.\n",
        " • Key Feature: An iterator implements two methods:\n",
        " 1. __iter__() – Returns the iterator object itself (so it can be used in loops).\n",
        " 2. __next__() – Returns the next item in the sequence. Raises StopIteration when no more items are available.\n",

        "1. Memory Efficiency\n",
        "\n",
        " • Advantage: Generators use lazy evaluation, which means they produce values one at a time and only when required, rather than creating a complete data structure in memory at once. This makes them more memory-efficient, especially for large sequences.\n",
        " • Example:\n",

        "2. Faster Execution for Iteration\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Infinite Sequences\n",
        "\n",
        " • Advantage: Generators can represent infinite sequences, which is impossible with regular lists due to memory constraints.\n",
        " • Example:\n",

        "def infinite_counter():\n",
        "    i = 0\n",

        "4. Pipeline Processing\n",
